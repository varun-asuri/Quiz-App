# Quiz-App

I made this app in 2020 as the final project for my Mobile App Development class. It is a quiz of all the Pokemon starters where it will show a silhouette and ask you to guess what Pokemon it is in similar fashion to the add breaks that come in the Pokemon show. After your answer it will tell you right or wrong and replace the silhouette with the colored image.
The app also tracks your current streak of correct answers and your highest streak on the app ever. If you go through all the starters correctly there is a victory screen.
